# Home Assignment - TV Series Search

This is the result of my 5-6 hours of work on this assignment.
The time was spent on the following

- 1h setup of the work environments
- 1.5h making the rudimentary search functions. List and Detail view components.
- 2.5h trying to make it look somewhat stylish, trying different style approaches and layouts

If I would have spent more time working on the assignment I would have added

- Tried out some more styling ideas
- Seasons and Episode lists
- An episode view with details about each episode
- Cast and Crewlists
