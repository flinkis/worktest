# Home Assignment - Movies

This is the result of my 5-6 hours of work on this assignment.
The time was spent on the following

- 1h setup of the work environments
- 1.5h making the rudimentary search functions. List and Detail view components.
- 2h trying to make RTK query to do what I wanted
- .5h trying to make it look somewhat stylish

If I would have spent more time working on the assignment I would have added

- A welcome screen
- Better pagginations, sent way to long time to try to make infinitscroll work
- Tests
